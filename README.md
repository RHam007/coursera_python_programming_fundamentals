The files here are simply short programs exploring various python programming concepts, tools, features, etc...
Any python application requiring more than 1 file will be seperated into its own repository, even if it also exists here while working thru the Coursera content.

Note: Unless otherwise stated, all code writen within these files is my own, and not part of the coursework, so is available for review or use as needed (would love to know if anyone ever DOES at least read the code samples, so please let me know!)
